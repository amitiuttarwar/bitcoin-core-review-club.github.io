## Notes

* The Bitcoin network uses `addr` messages to communicate addresses (the
  locations of nodes). To read more about the P2P message, you can see these
  [docs](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Protocol_documentation#addr).

* Sometimes, we send our own address to our peers so it can be
  propagated to new nodes on the network. It can be hard to get new peers if
  nobody knows about you :)

* Keep in mind that connections are asymmetric. We distinguish between inbound
  and outbound peers based on who initiated the connection. Think about what
  that entails for address discovery. If Node A initiates a connection to Node
  B, do they both necessarily know each others addresses?

* There are two code paths for checking & potentially relaying our address:

  1. When we are
     [processing](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/net_processing.cpp#L2498)
     the `version` message from a new connection,

  2. When we are starting the
     [SendMessages](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/net_processing.cpp#L4109)
     loop for a peer.

* Prior to this PR, these two code paths had similar but slightly different
  logic for advertising their addresses. This PR unifies the logical flows,
  which also entails some slight behavioral changes. Reviewing this PR requires
  understanding those differences to ensure they are safe. In some cases, we
  might have multiple addresses we can use to refer to ourselves. We'll dig
  into why that is during review club!

## Questions

1. Why do we advertise our own address? Is this necessary? When?

2. How often do we advertise our address? Why is this on a Poisson timer? Does
   this frequency make sense?

3. Why might we have multiple addresses for ourselves? Where do they come from?

4. What are the behavioral changes in this PR?

5. When you `PushAddress`, will this necessarily send an `addr` P2P message?

6. When you relay an `addr` out to a peer, what does the receiving peer do with
   the message? What would you anticipate occurring on the network as a whole?
