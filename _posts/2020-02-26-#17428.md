## Notes

An eclipse attack is when an attacker is able to isolate a node from all honest
peers.

This PR seeks to mitigate a specific type of eclipse attack by introducing
anchor connections, which are peers that a node tries to reconnect to on
startup.

### Background
- [PR 15759](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15759) changed the
  peer-to-peer behavior to add two _blocks-only_ connections. We discussed
  this change in a [previous Review Club
  meeting](https://bitcoincore.reviews/15759.html). I recommend you read
  the notes, questions and meeting log from that Review Club if you're not
  already familiar with those changes.

- [Eclipse attacks](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/eclipse-attacks/) occur
  when an adversary is able to isolate a victim's node from the rest of the
  network. We discussed eclipse attacks in previous Review Club meetings,
  including [the discussion on PR
  16702](https://bitcoincore.reviews/16702.html). If you're unfamiliar with the
  concept of eclipse attacks, [the Optech topics page](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/eclipse-attacks/) and the notes from that
  Review Club link to many resources on the subject.

- A _restart-based eclipse attack_ occurs when the adversary is able to add its
  own addresses to the victim's address manager and then force the victim to
  restart. If the attack succeeds, the victim will make all of its connections
  to the adversary's addresses when it restarts.

- [Issue 17326](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/17326) proposed
  persisting the node's outbound connection list to disk, and on restart
  reconnecting to the same peers. It's worth reading the full discussion in
  that issue, since there are a lot of subtle points around which peers
  should be persisted.

- This PR, [PR 17428](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17428) adds
  functionality to preserve outbound block-relay-only connections during
  restart.

### Issue 17326
- The most likely way for an eclipse attack to occur is by forcing a victim
  to restart and then taking over its connections with malicious peers.

- In the 2015 implementation of Bitcoin, an attacker could carry out a
  "connection starvation attack" where the attacker forces a victim to reboot and fills up all the free
  connection slots in the network, disabling the victim from connecting to any
  nodes. So, anchor connections would not have been an effective mitigation
  strategy.

- Since then, Bitcoin has implemented logic to sometimes rotate through
  incoming connections when the max number is hit. This means the victim has a
  way to successfully evict attackers connections and reconnect to its peers.
  While this means its possible for an attacker to eclipse a node without it
  rebooting, it also makes carrying out the eclipse attack more complex.

- Reconnecting outgoing connections makes the network graph more static. While
  this helps maintain longstanding honest connections and prevent an eclipse
  attack, this can have a negative effect on privacy since the network topology
  is easier to map.

- Other reasons anchoring all connections would be bad includes
1. A victim of an eclipse attack has no way of escaping
2. Strong persistence can contribute to the network self-partitioning. For example, if the longer
  distance connections are less reliable, nodes are incentivized to connect
  locally and this could lead to subgraphs per continent.
3. An attacker could eclipse nodes with a small number of nodes but 100% uptime
  and a large capacity for inbound connections. Every time a node adds a
  connection, if its an adversary that malicious node would be "locked in"
  forever with anchoring logic.

- The suggestion of using blocks-relay-only peers mitigates the concerns around
  reduced outbound peer rotation negatively impacting transaction privacy,
  while maintaing the benefit of mitigating from an eclipse attack.

### PR 17428
- The 2 outbound block-relay-only connections are written to the `anchors.dat`
  file. When a node restarts, it first tries establishing connections with the
  anchors before attempting to connect to other peers.

- Previously, a node that would quickly reattempt the same outgoing connections
  was detected as a spy or mass connector. This new behavior means that honest
  nodes will attempt the same outgoing connections more than once, which was
  unlikely before.

- The current state of this implementation introduces a new risk- if one of the
  anchor peers is malicious and is able to exploit a DoS vulnerability, they
  can repeatedly crash the victim's node.

  The proposed fix is to forget the anchor peers on an unclean exit.

  In reaction to these findings, the PR was [closed](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17428#issuecomment-583737058)
  but then re-opened based on a comment saying there are still advantages of
  preserving connections when restarting a node. The implementation of the
  proposed fix is yet to come.

  c. How does this PR mitigate the attack? What are some limits?

3. How does the anchors.dat file work?
  a. When are peers persisted and removed?
  b. When does the node ignore the contents of anchors.dat?
  c. What are some implications of the timing of adding peers?

4. What are the conditions for adding an anchor?
  a. Why are the anchors blocks-only peers?
  b. What would be the issue of using normal (transaction & block relay) peers
  as anchors?
  c. What are limitations of how this implementation chooses anchors?
  d. Why limit to only 2 anchors?

5. With the current implementation, how could an adversary carry out an attack?
   How does the attack have to change?

6. What is the new risk that this implementation currently introduces? What are
   the tradeoffs of the proposed fix (yet to be implemented)? Do you think the
   changeset would still be worthwhile? Why?
