## Notes
- Today's PR has been extracted from
  [#16698](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16698), which is a project
  to improve privacy that involves moving rebroadcast functionality from the
  wallet to the node. Having a smaller set of changes is always preferable
  since it makes the PR easier to reason about and review. We discussed #16698
  at a previous [review club](https://bitcoincore.reviews/16698.html).

- On current master, the wallet has a method called `ResendWalletTransactions`
  ([link](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/wallet/wallet.cpp#L1971)).
  This method is intended to _rebroadcast_ transactions, but also serves to
  ensure a successful initial broadcast. Since only the wallet that originated
  the transaction will announce it more than once, there is a potential privacy leak
  every time `ResendWalletTransactions` runs.

- Today's PR reduces the frequency that `ResendWalletTransactions` runs from
  ~30 min to every ~day. To do
  so, we extract the guarantees around initial broadcast.

- Lets clarify some language:
  - initial broadcast: when a node first notifies the network about a transaction
  - rebroadcast: when a node sends subsequent notifications to the network
    about that transaction
  - unbroadcast (introduced in this PR): when the initial broadcast of a
    transaction hasn't been deemed successful

- In this PR, the mempool keeps track of transactions that it attempts to initially
  broadcast. It uses a heuristic of receiving a relevant `GETDATA` to indicate
  a successful initial broadcast. Every 10-15 minutes, it re-attempts broadcast
  of the unbroadcast transactions (what a mouthful!)


## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or
   NACK?](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)
   (Don't forget to put your PR review on GitHub.)

2. How does the unbroadcast set work?
  - What transactions get added to the set?
  - When are transactions removed from the set?
  - What happens to transactions in the set?

3. What are possible failure scenarios?

4. Why do we only do this for our own transactions? Is there a potential
   privacy leak? How does this compare to current behavior in master?

5. Should `mempool.dat` be versioned?
