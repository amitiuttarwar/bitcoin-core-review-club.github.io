## Notes
- If a spy is able to identify which node initially broadcasted a transaction,
  it has a high degree of certainty that this node is the source wallet for the
  transaction.

- So we try to be intentional about how we relay and request transactions. We
  don't want to reveal the exact contents of our mempool or the precise timing
  when we received a transaction.

- [PR 18861] improved transaction-origin privacy. The idea is to not fulfill a
  `GETDATA` request from a peer who we haven't announced the transaction to
  yet. The implementation checks the list of transactions we are about to
  announce to the peer, `setInventoryTxToSend`. While this helps in many cases,
  its an imperfect heuristic. We would still fulfill a `GETDATA` from an
  attacker that connected to us in a timely way.

- This week's PR further reduces the possible attack surface. It introduces a
  per-peer rolling bloom filter `m_recently_announced_invs` to track which
  transactions were recently announced to the peer. When the peer requests a
  transaction, we check the filter before fulfilling the request & relaying the
  transaction.

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or
   NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?
   You're always encouraged to put your PR review on GitHub, even after it has
   been merged.

2. What are possible techniques for an adversary to probe a node for a
   particular mempool transaction? What changes with this PR?

3. What were drawbacks of using `setInventoryTxToSend` as a heuristic?

4. What is the `UNCONDITIONAL_RELAY_DELAY`? How is this delay constant being
   used when deciding whether or not to fulfill a request?

5. What are some relevant considerations when reviewing/implementing a bloom
   filter? What choices does this patch make?

6. After these changes, can you think of other ways a spy could probe for a
   mempool transaction?
