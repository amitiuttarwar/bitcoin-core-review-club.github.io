## Notes

- If a spy is able to identify which node initially broadcast a transaction,
  there's a high probability that that node is the source wallet for the
  transaction.

- To avoid that privacy leak, we try to be intentional about how we relay and request transactions. We
  don't want to reveal the exact contents of our mempool or the precise timing
  when we received a transaction.

- [PR 18861](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18861) improved
  transaction-origin privacy. The idea is that if we haven't yet announced a
  transaction to a peer, we shouldn't fulfill any `GETDATA` requests for that
  transaction from that peer.
  The implementation for that PR checks the list of transactions we are about to
  announce to the peer (`setInventoryTxToSend`), and if it finds the transaction
  that the peer has requested, then responds with a `NOTFOUND` instead of with the transaction. While this helps in many cases,
  it is an imperfect heuristic. Think about why that is (see question 3 below).

- This week's PR further reduces the possible attack surface. It introduces a
  per-peer rolling bloom filter (`m_recently_announced_invs`) to track which
  transactions were recently announced to the peer. When the peer requests a
  transaction, we check the filter before fulfilling the request and relaying the
  transaction.

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or
   NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?
   You're always encouraged to put your PR review on GitHub, even after it has
   been merged.

2. What are possible techniques for an adversary to probe a node for a
   particular mempool transaction? What changes with this PR?

3. What were drawbacks of using `setInventoryTxToSend` as a heuristic?

4. What is the `UNCONDITIONAL_RELAY_DELAY`? How is this delay constant being
   used when deciding whether or not to fulfill a request?

5. What are some relevant considerations when reviewing/implementing a bloom
   filter? What choices does this patch make?

6. After these changes, can you think of other ways a spy could probe for a
   mempool transaction?
