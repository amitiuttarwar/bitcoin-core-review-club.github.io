## Notes

- An [eclipse attack](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/eclipse-attacks/) is
  when an adversary is able to isolate a victim from the Bitcoin network by
  taking over all of its connections. We covered eclipse attacks in the review
  club meetings for [PR 16702](https://bitcoincore.reviews/16702#eclipse-attack) 
  and [PR 17428](https://bitcoincore.reviews/17428)

- Block-relay-only connections are a type of connection where nodes do not
  participate in transaction or address relay and only relay blocks. An
  effective way for a spy node to infer the network topology is to observe the
  timing and details of transaction and address relay, so these block-relay-only
  connections obfuscate network topology, helping to mitigate eclipse attacks.

- Block-relay-only connections were introduced in
  [#15759](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15759). After these changes,
  nodes by default open two outbound block-relay-only connections on startup.
  We discussed this PR in a [previous review
  club](https://bitcoincore.reviews/15759.html). Refer to the notes and log from
  that meeting if you're interested in learning more.

- This week's PR, [#19858](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19858),
  proposes a more advanced use of block-relay-only connections to further
  mitigate eclipse attacks. After this PR, the node will periodically initiate
  an additional block-relay-only connection, and then sync headers to try to
  learn about new blocks.

- After the node opens an additional block-relay-only connection to a peer, it
  begins to sync headers. If this reveals new blocks, the eviction logic will
  rotate out an existing block-relay-only connection. If no new blocks are
  discovered, the connection is closed. It's important for this eviction logic to
  be carefully reviewed.

## Questions

1. Did you review the PRs? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, ACK, or
   NACK?](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)

2. Describe a scenario in which periodic block-relay-only connections could
   help prevent an attack?

3. What are potential downsides to the concept? Are there any ways it could
   reduce security guarantees?

4. What happens if we learn about new blocks when opening one of these new
   block-relay-only connections?

5. How does the existing stale tip detection work? What are the differences
   compared to this mechanism?

6. How do we maintain the count for block-relay-only connections? What changes
   in this PR?

7. At a high level, how does outbound eviction work? What changes in this PR?
