## Notes
- An [eclipse attack](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/eclipse-attacks/) is
  when an adversary is able to isolate a victim from the bitcoin network by
  overtaking all of its connections.

- Block-relay-only connections are a type of connection where two nodes do not
  participate in transaction or address relay, and solely relay blocks. By
  obfuscating network topology, they help mitigate eclipse attacks.

- Block-relay-only connections were introduced in
  [#15759](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15759). After these changes,
  nodes by default open two outbound block-relay-only connections on startup.
  We discussed this PR in a [previous review
  club](https://bitcoincore.reviews/15759.html) if you are interested in
  learning more.

- This weeks PR, [#19858](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19858)
  proposes a more advanced use of block-relay-only connections to further
  mitigate eclipse attacks- periodically initiate new block-relay-only
  connections, and sync headers to see if we learn about new blocks.

- After the node opens a block-relay-only connection to a peer, it begins to
  sync headers. If this reveals new blocks, the eviction logic will rotate out
  an existing block-relay-only connection. If no new blocks are discovered, the
  connection is closed. It's important for this eviction logic to be
  carefully reviewed.


## Questions
1. What is a scenario under which periodic block-relay-only connections could
   help prevent an attack?
2. What are potential downsides to the concept? Are there any ways it could
   reduce security guarantees?
3. What happens if we learn about new blocks when opening one of these new
   block-relay-only connections?
4. How does the existing stale tip detection work? What are the differences
   compared to this mechanism?
5. How do we maintain the count for block-relay-only connections? What changes
   in this PR?
6. At a high level, how does outbound eviction work? What changes in this PR?
