## Notes

* The Bitcoin network uses `addr` messages to communicate addresses (the
  locations of nodes). To read more about the P2P message, you can see these
  [docs](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Protocol_documentation#addr).

* Self announcements (also known as self advertisements) are when a node sends
  an addr message to a peer containing its own ip address. Proper address
  propagation improves network connectivity and increases the difficulty of
  executing an eclipse attack.

* When we receive an addr message that contains 10 or less addresses, we
  forward them to 1-2 peers. This is the main technique we use for self
  advertisements, so sending to peers that wouldn't relay would effectively
  "blackhole" the trickle. wo known cases where peers would not participate in
  addr relay are if they have connected to you as a block-relay-only
  connection, or if they are a light client.

* This PR defers initialization of `m_addr_known` of inbound peers until the
  peer sends an address related message (`addr`, `addrv2`, `getaddr` or
  `sendaddrv2`). Then it uses the presence of `m_addr_known` to decide whether
  the peer is a candidate for relaying `addr` messages received from the
  network.


## Questions

1.  Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?
    What was your review approach?

2. What is an addr blackhole? Why is this a concern for addr propagation?

3. What is the self advertisement logic implemented in bitcoin core? How would
   you expect a single advertisement to propagate throughout the network?

4. How does this PR propose to improve addr blackholes? What are possible
   issues an approach like this could have? What does this approach *not*
   address?

5. What are the addr related P2P messages in the bitcoin protocol? What do each
   of them mean? How does the logic to send and receive each message change with
   this PR?

6. Could this change potentially be disruptive to other software on the
   network? How so?

7. What are alternative approaches for achieving the intended goal?
