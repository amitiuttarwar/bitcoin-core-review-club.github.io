## Notes

* The Bitcoin network uses `addr` messages to communicate network addresses
  (the locations of nodes). See the [Bitcoin wiki p2p
  documentation](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Protocol_documentation#addr) for
  more details.

* Good address propagation improves network connectivity and increases the
  difficulty of executing an eclipse attack.

* Bitcoin Core nodes will periodically self-announce (also known as
  self-advertise) their own network address to peers.

* When a Bitcoin Core node receives an `addr` message that contains 10
  addresses or fewer, it forwards them to 1 or 2 peers, selected at random.
  If we assume all nodes do this, then self-announcements should reach a large
  portion of the nodes on the network.

* However, we know that some nodes on the network do _not_ relay `addr` messages
  that they receive. Two known cases are block-relay-only connections from Bitcoin
  Core nodes, and connections from certain light clients. We refer to these
  connections as `addr` black holes. `addr` messages go in, but they never escape!

* If a large portion of the connections on the network are `addr` black holes, then
  `addr` propagation is impacted. Self-announcements won't reach a majority of nodes
  on the network. It'd be better if we could somehow avoid picking black holes as
  the 1 or 2 peers that we select for relaying `addr` messages to.

* This PR defers initialization of `m_addr_known` of inbound peers until the
  peer sends an address related message (`addr`, `addrv2`, `getaddr` or
  `sendaddrv2`). The node uses the presence of `m_addr_known` to decide whether
  the peer is a candidate for relaying `addr` messages received from the
  network.

## Questions

1.  Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?
    What was your review approach?

2. What is an `addr` black hole? Why is this a concern for `addr` propagation?

3. How does Bitcoin Core implement self-announcements? How would you expect a
   single advertisement to propagate throughout the network?

4. How does this PR propose to improve `addr` black holes? What are possible
   issues an approach like this could have? What does this approach *not*
   address?

5. What are the `addr` related p2p messages in the bitcoin protocol? What do
   each of them mean? How does the logic to send and receive each message
   change with this PR?

6. Could this change potentially be disruptive to other software on the
   network? How so?

7. What are alternative approaches for achieving the intended goal?
